# **UX DESIGN**

- ## **Strategy** 

    Codizilla is an online event-planning platform, aimed at developers who, regardless of their experience, want to organise and participate in meetups in order to extend their skills, network and portfolio around:
    - a group or open-source project, 
    - a study group to learn and expand on a specific language or framework 
    - a working group to help each others with cvs and cover letters or
    - a drink to simply meet and socialize    
    
    The site owner, as a remote student on a full-stack development course, appreciates that it can be a lonely process and has enjoyed meeting with fellow students on the course, working and socializing together on an array of projects. 

    **Site owner goal**

    - To provide an easy and engaging community platform where users can create and join meetups
    - To expand on software development skills using Python, Flask and MongoDB
    - To create a minimum viable product that can be further developed with additional features   

    **User goals** 

    - To access a user-friendly website across multiple devices 
    - To build a community with other developers around shared-interests and collaborative projects by joining and/or organising meetups.
